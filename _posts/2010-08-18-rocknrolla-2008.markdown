Hoy ví la película [RocknRolla ](http://rocknrolla.warnerbros.com/) y un diálogo llamó tanto mi atención que lo transcribí. En la escena está Johny tocando el piano en un bar, tratándole de explicarle a su amigo Pete.





<blockquote>

JOHNY:
You see that pack of Virginia killing sticks on the end of the piano?
PETE:
Yes.
JOHNY:
All you need to know about life is retained within those four walls. You will notice that one of your personalities is seduced by the illusions of grandeur. A gold packet of king size with a regal insignia. An attractive implication toward glamour and wealth. A subtle suggestion that cigarettes are indeed your royal and loyal friends. And that, Pete, is a lie.
JOHNY:
 Your other personality is trying to draw your attention to the flip side of the discussion. Written in boring, bold, black and white, is the statement...that these neat little soldiers of death, are, in fact, trying to kill you. And that, Pete, is the truth.
JOHNY:
 Oh, beauty is a begulling call to death and I'm addicted to the sweet pitch of its siren.
JOHNY:
 That that starts sweet ends bitter. And that which starts bitter ends sweet.
JOHNY:
That is why you and I love the drugs...and that is also why I cannot give that painting back.
</blockquote>
